Nowadays integration and interoperability can make or break an enterprise's business success. In the huge space that is software engineering a lot of ESBs have emerged but with vast differences in implementation, patterns and architectures. 

To create order in this disarray studies have been made, features evaluated and performance measured. This is a good thing but it does not clear up all the confusion and adds another layer of confusion regarding the studies and tests themselves. 

The aim of this thesis is to make an attempt of rectifying some of the disorder by first evaluating the current body of knowledge and to provide a humble attempt of making a transparent test framework which could be used for a more coherent ESB evaluation.
