	abstract = {Nowadays integration and interoperability studies and research have become hot topics in business field, providing technologies which enable Enterprise Application Integration (EAI). In this sense, Enterprise ServiceBus (ESB) products have gained a significant prominence as the mechanisms for supporting EAI. As a consequence, several ESB products from both commercial and open source have emerged. Due to the importance of using open source solutions for several areas, such as business and research field, studies about some open ESB products should be done. Moreover, in these studies the integration of existing services and processes should be studied. The aim of this paper is to evaluate some of the most important open ESBs by indicating the main features and the performance differences between them concerning the integration of existing services and processes in each of the ESBs analyzed.}

Things moved to more gravity when the bulkiest of the systems like Defense architectures came into picture, with the advent of this not of the efficiency but also the factors like stability, reliability, resource utilization were also of pivotal importance. This paper reviews a critical and comparative analysis of the current ESB's keeping in view the C4I System as a base, so as to ascertain which ESB fulfills the requirements of the system of systems. In comparison we try to analyze Mule ESB, GlassFish ESB and Fuse ESBwith respect to interoperability. This study demonstrates that Mule is more feasible to C4I systems because it is simple, easy to integrate, no adopter requirement and flexible.}

	abstract = {Since 2006 NICTA has been developing and trialing service-oriented performance modeling (SOPM), a method and tool support for performance modeling of large-scale heterogeneous service oriented architectures (SOAs). This technology enables software architects to rapidly build performance models of SOAs directly in terms of servicecompositions. Enterprise service buses (ESBs) are an increasingly common style of SOA infrastructure and implementation technology that we have encountered and modeled in e-government SOA projects. In this paper we show the application of our SOPM approach to the MULE enterprise service bus loan broker application in a laboratory context. We give a high-level outline of the SOPM method, and introduce the MULE ESB and loan broker application. We describe how a SOPM of the loan broker application is built in terms of applicationbusiness-logic services and MULE infrastructure service components, and parameterized with measurements from an experimental test-bed. We demonstrate the validity of the approach in an initial scenario, and then explore the modeling of alternative deployment and application scenarios.}

The goal of this case study is to identify the possible benefits and bottlenecks of adopting SOA, as well as to come up with best practices and research directions based on real-life experience gained in IT industry. The case involves an application portfolio of over 700 systems for a company in the transport sector. First, the case study involves the engineering of a portal application involving the integration of various services via the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB). Second, the case study is concerned with the setting up of a central coordination point within the organization to deal with SOA-related integrationrequests and requirements coming from different business units. Finally, the case discusses the actual implementation and integration of a service through the ESB. From this case study, a list of lessons learned and research directions is obtained.}

In this paper, it firstly analyses the current state of enterprise integration and the drawbacks of the hub-and-spoke topology, then it introduces a new design approach for EAI base on ESB called EAI-ESB. The EAI-ESBapproach which contains Message construction, Messaging channels, Listener, Decryptor, Validator, Enricher, Transformer and Router eight steps ensures consistent and validated data will be routed throughout the ESBbetween several applications. HTTP Binding SOAP message is one of important decisions in the EAI-ESBapproach. At last we summarize the advantages of the EAI-ESB approach and conclude EAI-ESB approach is one of the efficient ways to implement enterprise application integrations.}

	abstract = {Popular code coverage measures, such as branch coverage, are indicators
		of the thoroughness rather than the fault detection capability of
			test suites. Mutation testing is a fault-based technique that measures
			the effectiveness of test suites for fault localisation. Unfortunately,
		use of mutation testing in the software industry is rare because
			generating and running vast numbers of mutants against the test cases
			is time-consuming and difficult to do without an automated, fast
			and reliable tool. Our objective is to present an innovative approach
			to mutation testing that takes advantage of a novel aspect-oriented
			programming mechanism, called `pointcut and advice`, to avoid multiple
			compilation of mutants and, therefore, to speed up mutation testing.
			An empirical comparison of the performance of the developed tool,
		called <span class='snippet'>Judy</span>, with the MuJava mutation
			testing tool on 24 open-source projects demonstrates the value of
			the presented approach. The results show that there is a statistically
			significant (<i>t</i>(23) = -12.28, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0005, effect
					size <i>d</i> = 3.43) difference in the number of mutants generated
			per second between MuJava (<i>M</i> = 4.15, SD = 1.42) and <span
			class='snippet'>Judy</span> (<i>M</i> = 52.05, SD = 19.69). Apart
			from being statistically significant, this effect is considered very
			large and, therefore, represents a substantive finding. This therefore
			allows us to estimate the fault detection effectiveness of test suites
			of much larger systems.},
