\section{System setup}
 In order to minimize the amount of factors that interfere in the tests we consider having at least three similar state of the art computers connected to a high-speed network essential.
It might not be of the greatest importance that the computers are state of the art but in order to not reach a hardware ceiling while testing, such machines are recommended. Whats most important is that one computer is designated to run ESBs, one is designated to generate traffic while the others are simple servers responding to the traffic generated. 

This separating and designating of roles to machines minimizes different hardware affecting test results as the same machines perform the same roles in all tests and the only thing changed is the ESB. 

It also means that if other machines are used in other tests the data produced can be compared to ours and as such validate the data or identify faults in the tests. This validation can be in two ways. First is to run the same software versions and compare the results. They should be similar deviating only in magnitude. The second way is if using a newer or old software version the values when put in a graph will either have the same shape or show areas in which performance has changed, it it is the same shape but the magnitude is higher then that is most likely caused by faster machines being used and vice versa if its the same magnitude except in certain areas then that shows an improvement in the software.

\section{Test walktrough}
The tests described below are aimed at measuring the very basic roles of any ESB. They are very simple with the specific goal of producing a baseline for future tests.
\subsection{Pure throughput}
The ESB will in this test not manipulate any data but instead will forward all requests as fast as possible. 
A comparative test can be performed here aswell and that is to not use the ESB which will show what performance impact the ESB adds. 
\subsection{Routing}
In this test the ESB will depending on the context of an incoming request from the traffic generator send the request to an appropriate web service which will append some data and return the request to the ESB which will send it to the traffic generator.

This represents the ability to have several system behind an ESB all showing the same front to the outside.
\subsection{Message transformation}
The ESB will convert an incoming request to a different format and send it to a webservice which will append some data and return the request to the ESB which will transform it back into the format the traffic generator originally sent it. This second transform is meant to mimic how a real world application works, you do not send and receive using different protocols unless you're really forced too.
