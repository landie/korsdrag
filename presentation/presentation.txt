1) Defining the area and a problem (be as dramatic as you can be here don’t exaggerate though).

{``independent islands of computing''}
	{too expensive to replace}
	{age}
	{wastly different technologies and protocols}

{Almost all western companies have legacy systems}
	{integrate}
	{buy new}

{point to point}
	{Spaghetti integration}
	{No scaling whatsoever}
	{Extremely complex very fast}

{hub-n-spoke}
	{Less spaghetti integration}
	{Somewhat scalable}
	{Single point of failure}


enter the esb. 
{Enterprise Service Bus}
	{like hub-n-spoke}
	{scalable}
	{no single point of failure}

3) Present research questions and research approach
This thesis is focused on performance testing and as such our research questions are aimed for that specific field.

{Research questions:}
	{RQ1: What is the state of the art knowledge of ESBs in academic literature publications?}
	{RQ2: What is the state of the art knowledge of ESBs in industrial literature publications?}
	{RQ3: What are the components of a reproducable and accurate ESB performance testing framework.}


{Literature review}
{Testing framework}
{Result analysis}

4) Present your results and findings

{lägg in tabellen på vad industrin gjort}

{academi tabellen}

{sen vårt testresultat}
{utan esb resultat}

5) Discuss the results, their relation to already existing knowledge, their relevance and contribution. Discuss validity threats.

{RQ1-2}
	{industry}
		{old}
		{biased}
		{good scenarios}
	{academia}
		{non-existent}
		{questionable results}

{RQ3}
	{Framework works}
	{Need ESB specific "experts"}
	{Faster network}

{Validity}
	{Missed papers}
	{Bad code}

6) Improvements and future work.

{Code is on github} {länk kanske?}
{Getting ESB makers make the esb used in testing}
{increase complexity of framework}
